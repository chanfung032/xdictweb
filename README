# README for xdictweb #

xdictweb is a tool I used to recite english words. It consist of two parts:

    xdict: It is modified from the Google dictionary extension for chrome
           which will send all the words you looked up to the xdictweb.
    xdictweb: A web application to displays the words you have looked up in
              the xdict.

## HOWTO ##

1.  Install the `Xdict-Chrome-Extension` on your chrome.

2.  Visit `http://xdictweb.sinaapp.com`, login with your sina weibo account.
    go to the `admin` dashboard. Copy your xdict `accesskey` and paste it 
    into the text box with label `accesskey` in your xdict's option page.

3.  Done! Look up the word with xdict. Now all the words you looked up will
    be logged in the xdictweb's database.

4.  Visit `http://xdictweb.sinaapp.com` and recite the words wherever whenever
    your want. Enjoy!
